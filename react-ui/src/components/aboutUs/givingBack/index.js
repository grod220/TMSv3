      Isabella Morgia di Vicari and Jeff Morgia, co-owners of the Meatball
      Stoppe, developed the Community International Culinary Program for youth.
      Their mission is to feed families physically, emotionally, and
      spiritually---with a focus on healthy families as well as healthy bodies.
      With busy schedules and the daily pressures of life, meal time is more
      important than ever. Itâ€™s about giving kids hope, inspiration, and getting
      them back to the table.
